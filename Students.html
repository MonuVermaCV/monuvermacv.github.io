      <p align="justify"> <span class="university" style="color:black;font-weight:bold"> Research Interest?</span>
         My current research is centered around the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in the domains
         of medical science and healthcare. I am deeply committed to advancing the use of AI to address critical challenges in various computer vision fields.  
Firstly, a significant portion of my research efforts is devoted to developing innovative algorithms that enhance the autonomous capabilities of neural 
         architecture searching. This involves creating new methods and tools that allow AI systems to more effectively and independently discover optimal neural 
         network architectures. Additionally, I have recently delved into the exciting realm of federated learning. I am also engaged in research within the 
         challenging field of affective computing, with a specific focus on psychological aspects. Affective computing involves developing AI systems that can 
         recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions and affective states. In the context of psychological aspects, I am working on solutions that can assist 
         in understanding and addressing mental health-related issues through AI-driven analysis and intervention.</p>
            <p  <p align="justify">I strongly believe that innovation thrives at the intersection of diverse disciplines and novel ideas. I am always eager to embrace fresh perspectives 
               and venture into uncharted territories within the realm of AI and beyond. This openness to innovation means that I actively welcome and seek out new and 
               challenging areas of research.
<br>
Whether it's exploring emerging technologies, tackling complex interdisciplinary problems, or collaborating with experts from various fields, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and fostering creativity. I firmly believe that some of the most profound breakthroughs come from the fusion of different concepts and methodologies.
<br>
In this spirit, I am open to engaging in cross-disciplinary collaborations and tackling projects that may not fit neatly into predefined categories. By doing so, I aim to contribute not only to the advancement of AI but also to the broader landscape of science and technology, where innovative ideas have the power to reshape our understanding and improve our world.</p>

        <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already been around since decades. But due to the recent progress in Deep Learning, it is poised to disrupt our 
            world in . The AI-enabled intelligent machines are enabling 
            high-level cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem-solving, decision making. Along with 
            advances in data collection, aggregation, analytics, computer processing power, AI presents opportunities to complement and 
            supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and work. AISoC aims to be a launching pad for students eager to
            take up a research or industry career in AI. We recognize the high aspirations of students to excel in academia, industry, and 
            entrepreneurship. Thus, we focus on catering to the various career directions in AI. The vision of the society 
            is to provide content, guidance and practical experience to students of KIIT in building a community of like-minded individuals. </p>
